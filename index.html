        <p class="text-muted text-left">A school library is a library within a school where students, staff, and often, parents of a public or private school have access to a variety of resources. The goal of the school library media center is to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access "to books and reading, to information, and to information technology. A school library media center is automated, and utilizes the Internet and books for information gathering. School libraries are distinct from public libraries because they serve as "learner-oriented laboratories which support, extend, and individualize the school's curriculum. A school library serves as the center and coordinating agency for all material used in the school. Researchers have demonstrated that school libraries have a positive impact on student achievement through the more than 60 studies that have been conducted in 19 U.S. states and one Canadian province. The major finding of these studies was that students with access to a well-supported school library media program with a qualified school library media specialist, scored higher on reading assessments regardless of their socio-economic statuses. In addition, a study conducted in Ohio revealed that 99.4% of students surveyed believed that their school librarians and school library media programs helped them succeed in school. A report that reported similar conclusions was compiled by Michele Lonsdale in Australia in 2003.</p>

      </h5>
		  <p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat, or light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution. In 2015, pollution killed 9 million people worldwide.

Major forms of pollution include air pollution, light pollution, litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, visual pollution, and water pollution. So, we did the Inter School Debate On Environment Pollution and won.</p>

      </h5>
      <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.

There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century. The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire. By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage. In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world. Everybody enjoys football too, so our school organised the compitition.</p>

      </h5>
      <p>A science compitition is a competitive event, hosted by schools worldwide. The distinguishing characteristic of a science compitition is that project entries employ the scientific method to test a hypothesis. Science compitition are not exhibits or mere displays of projects. Students present their science project results in the form of a report, display board, and/or models that they have created. Science compitition allow students in elementary, middle and high schools to compete in science and/or technology activities. The goal of a science compitition is for students to answer a question based on a hypothesis. Students often work on science compitition projects in addition to their school work. Therefore, most science compitition entries are usually modified versions of existing experiments. Display boards help communicate the nuances of a project to science fair judges, visitors, and other entrants.

Science compitition may also allow for students with intense interest in the sciences to be paired with mentors from nearby colleges and universities, so that the students have access to instruction and equipment that the local schools do not provide. So our principal organised this event.</p>

Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed description of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy
                Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated  attendance management systems insure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with annual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
                <br>
                2.Economics    
                Have you ever thought that attendance management system could controll costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardliness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by Axsium Group found that large organisations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management system.
                <br>
                    3. Productivity / Efficiency
                Monitoring and managing  attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keepping track of employee hours to automatically importing imformation into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
